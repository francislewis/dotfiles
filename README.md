# dotfiles

I am runnning Elementry OS freya based on Ubuntu 14.04 at the moment

My dotfiles.
Included are my dotfiles for:

1. conky configs

2. [atom.io](https://atom.io/)

3. bash prompt - made with [this](http://bashrcgenerator.com/).
 
4. terminal profile configurations
 
5. script to autostart conky after a few seconds

6. nautilus scripts 

7. [sshrc](https://github.com/Russell91/sshrc) (mirrors my .bashrc when in ssh) 

8. My gimp config, looks like photoshop a bit
 
I also use [nanorc/nanorc](https://github.com/nanorc/nanorc) for my nano config and [the fuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) to correct my commands.
