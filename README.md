# dotfiles

I am runnning Elementry OS freya based on Ubuntu 14.04 at the moment

My dotfiles.
Included are my dotfiles for:

1. conky configs

2. <a href="https://atom.io/">atom.io</a> 

3. bash prompt - made with <a href="http://bashrcgenerator.com/">this</a>.
 
4. terminal profile configurations
 
5. script to autostart conky after a few seconds

6. nautilus scripts 

7. <a href="https://github.com/Russell91/sshrc">sshrc</a> (mirrors my .bashrc when in ssh) 

8. My gimp config, looks like photoshop a bit
 
I also use <a href="https://github.com/nanorc/nanorc">nanorc/nanorc</a> for my nano config and [the fuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) to correct my commands.
